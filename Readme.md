Simple humidity sensor

Hardware:
1) DHT11 (22) - Used as sensors
2) STM32F030F4 - System MCU
3) OLED display based on SSD1306

Introduction:
Device is capable in collecting data from humidity sensors and display it on screen. Device should control FAN based on humidity level from inner & outer sensors

Todo: implement PWM-FAN control
